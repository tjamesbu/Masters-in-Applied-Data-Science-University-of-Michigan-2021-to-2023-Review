## Review and Reflection of my course experiences during the University of Michigan and Coursera's Masters in Applied Data Science
## Fall 2021 Cohort -- Class of Winter 2023


## Overview
This repository is a reflection of my experiences during the Masters of Applied Data Science online program through the University of Michigan and Coursera, as well as a heads-up for current and incoming students who feel overwhelmed and do not know what to expect. Most of the program was a very influential experience that I gained and learned a lot from.  This is due to the professors that put forth the respectful effort towards considering and supporting all of the enrolled students. I will share with you here a brief description of what is included in each course, the level of difficulty, the amount of impact professors vs classmates had in helping me learn during each course, and any challenges I experienced that you may be confronted with also.  The UMich commumity that is willing to support one-another is what makes UofM such a special and spirited community to be a part of. I will also mention activities I was able to partake-in that I recommend you try-out also during your University of Michigan experience.  Feel free to reach-out to me by email if you are currently in the program and have any questions I can help you out with. You can contact me here, or you can find my email through requesting the list of MADS tutors from MADS Academic Advisng.

## My Personal Background
As a youth I grew-up enjoying individual studies of the outdoor sciences (especially entomology and herpetology), camping, hiking, astronomy, herbal medicines, sports, and instrumental-music (trumpet, piano).  I had to face a medical challenge that most people do not, yet did not let that slow me down, and believe that it helped me develop more self-motivation than the average person.  I come from a larger-than-normal family.   I completed my bachelors in biology at a smaller Catholic university located in Lisle, IL called Benedictine University. After my bachelors degree I used the teaching-skills I had inherited from my mother and my extracurriculars' leadership trainings to substitute-teach grades K-12 for 7 years, as well as private-tutor all ages (mostly middle-school & high-school) for 13 years.  This gave me the knowledge needed to differentiate student learning-personalities and become more familiar with the most effective teaching-methods.  In 2017 I discovered an opportunity to travel to Ecuador, and while down there discovered Coursera online courses. Hiking up an active volcano, and hiking around the crater-rim of an extinct volcano, only gave me more confidence of being capable of handling any future challenges I may face. After about a year of Coursera online courses; mostly in Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI; I discovered UofM's online Masters in Applied Data Science (MADS). I was accepted into the MADS program July 2021 and started in August 2021. 

## Extra advice
Expect and request extra office hours whenever you feel it would help you more with the course.  Multiple MADS professors, and MADS course developers, are still unaware of the most effective MADS course setup for online students.

Take advantage of the free experience to enter your Capstone project into the UMSI Expo!  You will need to keep an eye-out in your umich.edu email for the invite to it during the Winter semester during (or following) your Capstone. If you are taking your Capstone project course during the Spring/Summer or Fall semesters, you can still sign-up to present your Capstone project at the UMSI Expo during the following Winter semester. Contact the UMSI Engaged Learning Office for more details. Most of my Capstone classmates stated they had never heard anything about the UMSI Expo due to its lack-of-publication.  The project poster deadline will be about 2-weeks before Capstone ends.  The virtual and in-person project exposition will consist of in-person and online students, and will last for two hours on a Monday afternoon (3-5pmEST for Winter 2023). You do not need your entire capstone project group's participation to enter.  When entering your project info, if you are not filling-out the UMSI Expo application as-a-team, only enter your name and request to have your team-members' names added later if they decide to help you create the project poster needed to enter.  Enjoy sharing your hopes and aspirations for your capstone project idea with others in the community that also want to work towards improving society for everyone.  (Secret Hint:  I recommend developing a project focused on improving education throughout the country, throughout the state, or, throughout the internet.  Both 1st and 2nd prizes for Winter 2023 Capstone projects were focused on improving access-to-education and school-district management).

I also recommend joining the professional organization Society of Learning Analytics and Research (SoLAR) and entering for a scholarship to the international
