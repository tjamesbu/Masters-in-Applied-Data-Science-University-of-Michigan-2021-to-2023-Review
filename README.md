## Review and Reflection of my course experiences during the University of Michigan and Coursera's Masters in Applied Data Science
## Fall 2021 Cohort -- Class of Winter 2023


## Overview
This repository is a reflection of my experiences during the Masters of Applied Data Science online program through the University of Michigan and Coursera, as well as a heads-up for current and incoming students who feel overwhelmed and do not know what to expect. Most of the program was a very influential experience that I gained and learned a lot from.  This is due to the professors that put forth the respectful effort towards considering and supporting all of the enrolled students. I will share with you here a brief description of some things you can expect for each course.  The UMich commumity that is willing to support one-another is what makes UofM such a special and spirited community to be a part of. I will also mention activities I was able to partake-in that I recommend you try-out also during your University of Michigan experience.  Feel free to reach-out to me by email (tjamesum@umich.edu, tjamesbu@gmail.com) if you are currently in the program and have any questions I can help you out with. 

## My Personal Background
As a youth I grew-up enjoying individual studies of the outdoor sciences (especially entomology and herpetology), camping, hiking, astronomy, herbal medicines, sports, and instrumental-music (trumpet, piano).  I had to face a medical challenge that most people do not, yet did not let that slow me down, and believe that it helped me develop more self-motivation than the average person.  I come from a larger-than-normal family.   I completed my bachelors in biology at a smaller Catholic university. After my bachelors degree I used the teaching-skills I had inherited from my mother and my extracurriculars' leadership trainings to substitute-teach grades K-12 for 7 years, as well as private-tutor all ages (mostly middle-school & high-school) for 13 years.  This gave me the knowledge needed to differentiate student learning-personalities and become more familiar with more effective teaching-methods.  In 2017 I discovered an opportunity to travel to Ecuador, and while down there discovered Coursera online courses. Hiking up an active volcano, and hiking around the crater-rim of an extinct volcano, only gave me more confidence of being capable of handling any future challenges I may face. After about a year of Coursera online courses; mostly in Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI; I discovered UofM's online Masters in Applied Data Science (MADS). I was accepted into the MADS program July 2021 and started in August 2021. I graduated in April 2023. During my experience in MADS I was a member of MADSA (Michigan Applied Data Science Association), MDST (Michigan Data Science Team), and the Society of Learning Analytics and Research (SoLAR).  I participated in the 2023 UMSI Project Exposition (2nd Prize for UMSI Capstone Projects). I also was granted a scholarship by SoLAR to attend the 2023 Learning Analytics Summer Institute (LASI) in Singapore (2024 will be in Kyoto, Japan, March 2024).

## Extra advice
Expect and request extra office hours whenever you feel it would help you more with the course.  Attend and/or watch as many MADS courses as possible.  Multiple MADS professors, and MADS course developers, are still unaware and learning about the most effective MADS course setup for online students.

Take advantage of the free experience to enter your Capstone project into the UMSI Expo!  You will need to keep an eye-out in your umich.edu email for the invite to it during the Winter semester during (or following) your Capstone. If you are taking your Capstone project course during the Spring/Summer or Fall semesters, you can still sign-up to present your Capstone project at the UMSI Expo during the following Winter semester. Contact the UMSI Engaged Learning Office for more details. Most of my Capstone classmates stated they had never heard anything about the UMSI Expo due to its lack-of-publication.  The project poster deadline will be about 2-weeks before Capstone ends.  The virtual and in-person project exposition will consist of in-person and online students, and will last for two hours on a Monday afternoon (3-5pmEST for Winter 2023). You do not need your entire capstone project group's participation to enter (I entered solo).  When entering your project info, if you are not filling-out the UMSI Expo application as-a-team, only enter your name and request to have your team-members' names added later if they decide to help you create the project poster needed to enter.  Enjoy sharing your hopes and aspirations for your capstone project idea with others in the community that also want to work towards improving society for everyone.  (Secret Hint:  I recommend developing a project focused on improving education throughout the country, throughout the state, or, throughout the internet.  Both 1st and 2nd prizes for Winter 2023 Capstone projects were focused on improving access-to-education and school-district management).

I also recommend joining the professional organization Society of Learning Analytics and Research (SoLAR) and entering for a Erik Duvall Travel Scholarship to the international Learning Analytics Summer Institute (LASI).  Learning Analytics is a newer area of research that is in-need of more younger data-scientists/data-analysts.

The MADSA (Masters in Applied Data Science Association) student organization is also a good community to become involved with.  They are constantly looking for new ideas to be used for monthtly or bimonthly student activities.  

Through email you may notice Ross School of Business invites to competitions such as Innovation & Tech Jam, Datathon, or Fintech Innovation Jam.  If you have some spare-time during the evenings, I recommend participating in these also.  They give you some extra knowledge on how to properly plan the startup a business, how to develop a project/business-startup pitch, and how to address societal issues that surround us.  You may or may not have to re-request that all of the competition events be accessible for online students also, for the competition leaders themselves are still adapting to having more online students.

The MDST (Michigan Data Science Team) is another student organization that online students can get involved in.  It will allow you further practice with developing visualizations or CNNs as part of a student-group.  My most recent project-group worked on developing wildfire-spread predictions using CNNs.

Semester IV (Fall 2022)
SIADS 696: Milestone II (month 1)
Students are expected to find project partners, establish project ideas, and prepare for the Written Cumulative Exam during the first four weeks.  Instead of completing a project that only contains supervised learning and data visualizations like you did in milestone 1, you now will complete a project that contains both supervised and unsupervised learning.  You have the option to add onto what you already completed in milestone 1 if you would like. You will need to figure-out what skills you and your project-partners feel confident with before getting started on a project idea.  You will complete a project-proposal form with your project partners.  Most of the current professors are not available during the first four weeks to answer all questions about project ideas, development, nor available tools...so you will have to continuously communicate with your project partners. For the Written Cumulative Exam you are given six questions and expected to be prepared to answer any two of them during week 4.  It is recommended, and easiest, if you complete your responses for all six questions during the first three weeks.  

You will gain more knowledge and support from fellow classmates than you will professors for this course. Current leadership developed for milestone 2 does not contain enough of an established protocol to expect professors to assist students with the essentials of data science project preparation.  Current professor guidelines (as of May 2023) state that teaching data-extraction from the internet is a skill that is non-related to the SIADS 696 Milestone II project course, and is not permitted to be taught by SIADS 696 professors. Data-extraction is also not taught in any of the MADS courses before

There is an outdated video giving an example or two on how to respond to Oral Exam questions, when only written questions are conducted now.  Professors will claim that the students should be able to prepare for the written cumulative exam on-their-own, and will use this as an excuse to ignore any exam or milestone 2 project preparation questions students may have during the first four weeks of SIADS 696. The guidance for getting-started on the project was very lacking, and assistance from professors is currently not planned to exist until project advisors are assigned during week 4 or 5.  

Again, don't hesitate to start talking to more classmates and learning more from them.  I would recommend direct-messaging 6-8 classmates at-a-time (if not more) while taking this course.  My desire to learn was at a much higher level than the professors' desire to teach during SIADS 696 Fall 2022 (and a current Spring/Summer 2023 student taking SIADS 696 has notified me that Gilbert and Coco Krumme's lack-of-effort towards showing support to online students has not been fixed, yet).

The two main professors you will most likely encounter in this course are Gilbert, Collins-Thompson, and Coco Krumme.  Collins-Thompson is also the Director of MADS, and has many other duties keeping him occupied, so your questions will mostly be answered (or unanswered) by Gilbert. Coco Krumme did not respond to any Slack posts until week 8 of my Milestone II, so there is not guarantee that she will be responsive until improved professor expectations are developed.  Gilbert will seem friendly if you don't have any questions for him that require a significant amount of thought.  He felt nothing wrong with ignoring my five different attempts to seek help from SIADS 696 professors during this first month. Feel free to let him know (as well as the MADS director and School of Information Dean) he is not doing his job whenever he seems to be responding carelessly, or ignoring you, during the first four weeks of SIADS 696. Also feel free to create more course reviews on Github about his unprofessional behavior towards online students. He is expected by the university to support online students more than he currently does. 

SIADS 652: Network Analysis


SIADS 696: Milestone II (month 2)
Your project team will be assigned a project advisor.  The project advisors are expected to meet with their project groups a minimum of twice during weeks 5-8, and as requested.  They are also supposed to be available for any questions and guidance needed by students enrolled in SIADS 696.  Project groups are expected to type and submit a project report by the end of week 8.  It is recommended that project groups plan to week weekly, and possibly more than weekly during the last two weeks.  

Again, I encourage reaching-out to classmates if professors are not responding within 24-48hrs.  I gained more knowledge in this course through my own trial-and-error and my project-partners' support.  Professors were supposed to be available for professional advice & support, but unfortunately were either not trained properly or not motivated properly.  

Gilbert met with our project group once, but did not have any input nor question-responses to offer us besides a few "Hmmmms" and "Yeahs". Sort-of felt like we were in the Office Space movie environment, having a professor that really didn't want to be there responding like Lumbargh.  Even after the dean had contacted him, Gilbert still felt okay with neglecting a portion of his students.  Reporting Gilbert's negligence to Director Collins-Thompson had no effect, and an associate dean stated a lot of lean-way is currently given to MADS professors.  All students can continue to work together on fixing this problem by continuing to specifically report Gilbert's unprofessional behaviors and Collins-Thompson's lack of managing Gilbert, in MADS course reviews.  Hopefully having more students speak-up about Gilbert's unprofessional behavior, and requesting changes be made for better regulating professors' behaviors towards online students, will eventually influence the School of Information and MADS staff enough to make the needed adjustments for fixing the student-neglect issues coming from some professors during milestones.

## If you are interested in learning more about where immediate improvements are still needed in the MADS & UMSI staff communications/developments, feel free to read below. It is unfortunate immediate remediation could not be performed for current students, and posting this I am hoping it will speed-up the desire for improvement from the MADS and UMSI staff.

More demo assignment lab-notebooks (such as what currently exists in SIADS 542, 543, and 652), and coding examples in lectures (such as what currently exists in SIADS 543), would be helpful.  Currently existing demo assignment lab-notebooks also could use updates to better match the updates made to weekly assignments. 

More office hours including professors that can provide example problems that demonstrate how to apply the course concepts in the assignments would be helpful.  Learning the concepts and applying the concepts are two different challenges...and the lectures currently only help with learning the concepts.  More office hours including previous research experience and reports in correlation with the weekly assignments, such as what Professor 

Provost office, the office that has a director's level of control over the planning and development of MADS, needs to be more interactive with the MADS students.  At a minimum, the same level of interaction that the School of Information Dean offers monthly...and communicating with students when they take action towards improvement of the School of Information.  Currently only one MADS professor is undertaking responsibility for suggesting further developments and improvements to MADS...and he is already busy serving as the professor for 3 different MADS courses. This is going to cause the improvements to occur very slowly, and more students to experience unneccesary neglect.  While moving through the milestone and capstone project courses over a period of two years to many noticable improvements, to prevent student neglect were needed...and only three or four professors worked towards constant improvement of the courses they tought. 

SIADS 696 (Milestone 2 Project) lacked the support you would normally receive from from a project leader at a quality company. Most of the current project advisors feel that one project advisiong meeting during the entire 8 weeks of the course duration is enough, and that the students should be capable of figuring-out alone any of the struggles they have. It has been reported by recent MADS students that some project advisors do not plan any Zoom meetings for project support during the entire milestone 2 project. The lead professor is already consumed with multiple other courses & duties, and does not have the spare time nor support needed to improve SIADS 696 anytime in the near future. Proof of this is displayed when he does does not have time to respond to reports of unprofesssional behavior by other MADS professors and will not respond to students who are recent graduates still seeking their professors' career/project advice that was not provided during SIADS 696. More of the executive leadership providing advising, or at least planned duties for student project-advising improvement plans that the MADS professors can follow, would be helpful for professors inexperienced in leading & teaching, and bring significant improvements to this course.

SIADS 593 (Milestone 1)/SIADS 696 (Milestone 2)/SIADS 699 (Capstone) : Project advising Zoom meetings will be more effective at helping students improve their data science project skills if scheduled for every other week, even when students claim they are doing fine and don't need any help. Most students are not aware when making small mistakes in their projects, and can make-use of the extra tips/advice professors can offer.


UMSI/MADS Deans:  Very friendly people that will offer discussion of issues students may have.  They unfortunately currently lack in the amount they can help neglected students due to the current leniency entrusted to professors to remain professional towards all students.
