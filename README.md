## Review and Reflection of my course experiences during the University of Michigan and Coursera's Masters in Applied Data Science
## Fall 2021 Cohort -- Class of Winter 2023


## Overview
This repository is a reflection of my experiences during the Masters of Applied Data Science online program through the University of Michigan and Coursera, as well as a heads-up for current and incoming students who feel overwhelmed and do not know what to expect. Most of the program was a very influential experience that I gained and learned a lot from.  This is due to the professors that put forth the respectful effort towards considering and supporting all of the enrolled students. I will share with you here a brief description of what is included in each course, the level of difficulty, the amount of impact professors vs classmates had in helping me learn during each course, and any challenges I experienced that you may be confronted with also.  The UMich commumity that is willing to support one-another is what makes UofM such a special and spirited community to be a part of. I will also mention activities I was able to partake-in that I recommend you try-out also during your University of Michigan experience.  Feel free to reach-out to me by email if you are currently in the program and have any questions I can help you out with.  

## My Personal Background
As a youth I grew-up enjoying individual studies of the outdoor sciences (especially entomology and herpetology), camping, hiking, astronomy, herbal medicines, sports, and instrumental-music (trumpet, piano).  I had to face a medical challenge that most people do not, yet still remained very actively involved in extracurriculars such as band, boy scouts, and 4-H.  I completed my bachelors in biology at a smaller Catholic university located in Lisle, IL called Benedictine University.  Most of my classmates were pre-med or pre-pharmacy, for Benedictine is well-known for having their students accepted into Midwestern University's med-school and pharmacy-school.  After my bachelors degree I used the teaching-skills I had inherited from my mother and my extracurriculars' leadership trainings to substitute-teach grades K-12 for 7 years, and private-tutor all ages (mostly middle-school & high-school) for 13 years.  In 2017 I discovered an opportunity to travel to Ecuador, and while down there discovered Coursera online courses.  After about a year of Coursera online courses mostly in Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI, I discovered UofM's online Masters in Applied Data Science (MADS).  As soon as I discovered the MADS entrance-exam covered python programming and statistics, and the python-programming portion can be waived if the applicant has already completed the University of Michigan's Python 3 Programming course specialization on Coursera, I immediately completed those courses.  I was accepted into the MADS program July 2021 and started in August 2021.
