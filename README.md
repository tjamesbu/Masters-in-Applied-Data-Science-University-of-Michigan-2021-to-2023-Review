## Review and Reflection of my course experiences during the University of Michigan and Coursera's Masters in Applied Data Science
## Fall 2021 Cohort -- Class of Winter 2023


## Overview
This repository is a reflection of my experiences during the Masters of Applied Data Science online program through the University of Michigan and Coursera, as well as a heads-up for current and incoming students who feel overwhelmed and do not know what to expect. Most of the program was a very influential experience that I gained and learned a lot from.  This is due to the professors that put forth the respectful effort towards considering and supporting all of the enrolled students. I will share with you here a brief description of what is included in each course, the level of difficulty, the amount of impact professors vs classmates had in helping me learn during each course, and any challenges I experienced that you may be confronted with also.  The UMich commumity that is willing to support one-another is what makes UofM such a special and spirited community to be a part of. I will also mention activities I was able to partake-in that I recommend you try-out also during your University of Michigan experience.  Feel free to reach-out to me by email if you are currently in the program and have any questions I can help you out with.  

## My Personal Background
As a youth I grew-up enjoying individual studies of the outdoor sciences (especially entomology and herpetology), camping, hiking, astronomy, herbal medicines, sports, and instrumental-music (trumpet, piano).  I had to face a medical challenge that most people do not, yet did not let that slow me down, and believe that it helped me develop more self-motivation than the average person.  I come from a larger-than-normal family.   I completed my bachelors in biology at a smaller Catholic university located in Lisle, IL called Benedictine University. After my bachelors degree I used the teaching-skills I had inherited from my mother and my extracurriculars' leadership trainings to substitute-teach grades K-12 for 7 years, as well as private-tutor all ages (mostly middle-school & high-school) for 13 years.  This gave me the knowledge needed to differentiate student learning-personalities and become more familiar with the most effective teaching-methods.  In 2017 I discovered an opportunity to travel to Ecuador, and while down there discovered Coursera online courses. Hiking up an active volcano, and hiking around the crater-rim of an extinct volcano, only gave me more confidence of being capable of handling any future challenges I may face. After about a year of Coursera online courses; mostly in Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI; I discovered UofM's online Masters in Applied Data Science (MADS). I was accepted into the MADS program July 2021 and started in August 2021. 

## Lack-of-Responses to be prepared for (A good reference for both MADS leaders and students)
During my 5 semesters of MADS I was able to learn which faculty respond supportively vs which do not.  I will list here some of my experiences with MADS staff so that you can have an idea about the level of respect and response you can expect from each MADS staff group, rather than having to feel surprised, isolated, and alone when being confronted with professors' potential unprofessional behaviors. I will update this list as more come-back to my mind. This is a mix of professors from the MADS courses, as well as other UMSI faculty I have attempted to reach-out to for support.

Academic Affairs:  They are great and friendly when you have questions about course and enrollment details.  They will direct your inquiries regarding disrespect & neglect from professors to the dean, whom may or may not reach-out to you offering help.  

School of Information Deans: The first dean I reported to, who has since been promoted to provost, fully ignored my request for help with neglect and ignorance from a few professors.  The temporary deans that replaced him were very responsive, but overall were not able to do much to fix a few professors' negligent behaviors.  I was notified that professors are given a lot of flexibility to make their own professional decisions, and no regulations have yet been developed to prevent them from fully ignoring an enrolled student.

## MADS Professor Rankings
I will rank the professors from most helpful & supportive to least helpful.  The purpose of this ranking is to help prevent MADS students from feeling isolated and not-a-part-of-the-MADS-community only because of a few bad apples in the MADS faculty.  We are all a community, and those of us who respect that have to support one another.  Do these bad apples mean you should not consider MADS?....No.  You will find a few bad apples no matter what school you decide to study data science at.
